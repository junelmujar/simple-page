###SimplePage.js 

*   A simple pagination plugin for paging data fetched via Ajax. No more, no less.
*   Easy configuration, takes all the hardwork of building the 
    control/widget for you =)
*   Bootstrap 3.0 support, depends on it for the controls
*   Supports sorting
*   Supports filters
*   Supports search
*   Display pager on top or bottom or both!
*   Display a preloader image
*   You control the formatting of the result via Handlebars.js templating!
    This means that you won't be mashing strings to format
    you result. Now you can do a grid based layout or if you
    prefer, a table/list format.
